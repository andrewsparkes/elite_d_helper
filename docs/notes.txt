EDS star data
# Add data controller to allow adding/updating all systems in radius around sol
use javascript and submit list to controller function

# check for existance of system by eds_id
# if system exists
#     check for coordinates and update if not matching
# else
#     insert system (name, coords, eds_id, 'unexplored' for allegiance)
# end
# report view shows what was done (collect array of insert/update messages)

# system model add self.distance_between(system_name_A, system_name_B)
# return -1 if no coords in one or both systems

# can now do clever stuff like trade routes with distance legs < X ly

# =====
Station commodities:

* change table to have separate fields for buy price, sell price, demand vol, demand level, supply vol, supply level? compatible with OCR
* remember last settings for D/S and L/M/H
* consider OCR file upload for station

# =====
