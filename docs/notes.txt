# Please note that the API uses

# type: 'POST'
# contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8'


# GetSystems
# Get a list of systems

# POST    api.asmx/GetSystems
# TYPE    Params                  Values
# POST    ver                     int (>=1)
# POST    test                    bool        [Optional][Default:false]
# POST    outputmode              int (1/2)   [Optional][Default:1]
# POST    filter                  Object containing all filter options [Optional]
# POST    knownstatus [filter]    int (0/1/2) [Optional][Default:0]
# POST    systemname [filter]     string [Optional]
# POST    cr [filter]             int (>=0) [Optional][Default:5]
# POST    date [filter]           "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss" || "yyyy-MM-dd" [Optional][Default: Now-24h]
# POST    coordcube [filter]      [[xmin,xmax][ymin,ymax][zmin,zmax]] [Optional] min is inclusive ">=", max is exlusive "<"
# POST    coordsphere [filter]    {radius:xxx.xx, origin:[x,y,z]} [Optional] radius is inclusive ">="


# ver
# ver must be send with all requests. Only the Major version number.
# Minor version numbers of the API are always backwards compatible with the Major version.

# test
# When test is true all queries are directed at a test DB.
# The test DB is a mirror of the non-test DB and is beeing mirrored every 24 hours at 1:15 UTC
# Please use the test flag when developing your apps, so we get as little trash as possible in the non-test DB.

# outputmode
# outputmode can be used to reduce bandwidth, as not all possible info is always required. A simple (Terse) list of names is fine for a dropdown list.
# 1 (Terse) - Returns only the names of the systems
# 2 (Verbose) - Returns id, name, coords, cr, who and when created/updated the system last.

# filter
# filter is an object wrapping the individual filter options

# knownstatus
# knownstatus filters on if a systems coordinates are known or not
# 0 (All) Default - Returns all systems, ie. "no filter".
# 1 (Known) - Returns only systems with known coordinates.
# 2 (Unknown) - Returns only systems not having known coordinates.

# systemname
# systemname Limit search to systems with names containing systemname

# cr
# cr Confidence Rating. How many times have an entry been confirmed.
# With a cr of 1 it could be a mis-typed system name. The chance of which is reduced with a higher cr number. Records with a cr equal or higher than the supplied value are returned.

# date
# date Date of last update.
# date is an UTC date.
# Records with an update date equal or higher than date are returned.
# Suggested use is to keep note of your last pull, and then only request records newer than that timestamp.

# coordcube
# coordcube limits the results to those starsystems contained by the defined cube

# coordsphere
# coordsphere Limits the result to those starsystems within the given radius of the origin

# Example code

# Code example
# Complete copy/paste ready code (Requires jQuery) - JSFiddle

# function getSystemData(){
# //var data = {data: {ver:2}}; //Just one required parameter - Simplest possible
# var data = {
#   data: {

#     outputmode:1,

# =====

# Distance calculation between 2 sets of XYZ coordinates:

# distance = root [ (X2 - X1)sqd + (Y2 - Y1)sqd + (Z2 - Z1)sqd  ]

# In Ruby use the Math module

# Numbers must be floats
# Math.sqrt(5.0) = 2.23606797749979

# Squared is N**2

# distance = Math.sqrt( ( (X2-X1)**2 ) + ( (Y2-Y1)**2 ) + ( (Z2-Z1)**2 ) )

# =====

# Add data controller to allow adding/updating systems in radius around system_name
# inputs: system name, radius, api ver

# check for existance of system by eds_id
# if system exists
#     check for coordinates and update if not matching
# else
#     insert system (name, coords, eds_id, 'unexplored' for allegiance)
# end
# report view shows what was done (collect array of insert/update messages)

# system model add self.distance_between(system_name_A, system_name_B)
# return -1 if no coords in one or both systems

# can now do clever stuff like trade routes with distance legs < X ly
